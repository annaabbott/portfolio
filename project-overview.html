            <p class="underline">Problem:</p>
            <p> The current website was not an effective recruiting tool. </p>
            <p class="underline">Solution:</p> 
            <p>We re-examined and redesigned the website from the perspective of the target user.</p>
            <p class="underline">Process: </p> 
            <p>Our design group performed user research to find out what prospective culinary students were looking for when they visited the website. We also conducted eye-tracking tests to find the weaknesses in the current website. Armed with this information, we created a new design employing a clear point of entry, hierarchy of information, and improved wayfinding.</p>

            <p>Team project. I was the lead on a team of three designers.</p>

        <div class="column small-12 medium-9 large-9 overview">
            <p class="underline">Problem:</p>
            <p> The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown abruptly changed education, and the school district website was no longer relevant.</p>
            <p class="underline">Solution:</p> 
            <p>I updated the design of the website to reflect the sudden changes in what students and their families needed from the district in the face of the pandemic.</p>
            <p class="underline">Process: </p> 
            <p>I restructured the hierarchy of the landing page, adding online tools to the top and moved less-needed links to the navigation menu. 
                I designed the transcript request form to be completed online, rather than a PDF that needed to be taken to the high school in person. 
                Finally, I created a gallery of images showcasing distance learning to emphasize that school was still in session and help students to feel less alone. 
                My redesigns of the landing page, transcript form, schools page, and gallery may be viewed online.</p>

        <div class="column small-12 medium-9 large-9 overview">
            <p class="underline">Problem:</p>
            <p> The players at my table with spellcasting characters had difficulty remembering the details of the spells they had chosen, 
                and we had only one Players Handbook between the six of us.</p>
            <p class="underline">Solution:</p> 
            <p>I created a website that the players could access with their device during the game. 
                The website lists the spells of the players' choosing as well as the details of those spells.</p>
            <p class="underline">Process: </p> 
            <p>I used the dnd5eapi to access the spells. The players access spells first by character class and second by magic level. 
                Clicking on the name of the spell shows the details of that spell, which players may then choose to add to their spellbook by clicking a button.
            Adding the spell to their spellbook enables the players to continue to browse through spells without losing track of the spells they liked.</p>

            <p class="underline">Problem:</p>
            <p> Create a study app that makes memorization feel less like a chore and more like a game.</p>
            <p class="underline">Solution:</p> 
            <p>Incorporate a quiz, 
                with gamification principles, into the design of a flashcard app.</p>
            <p class="underline">Process: </p> 
            <p>The overall design is based on the mental model of a set of flashcards. I improved the symbolic representation of flashcards by adding a drop-shadow to the individual cards.
                The app design gives the user the option to either study the design principles as if using a set of flashcards, or by taking a quiz.
                 The idea behind the quiz is to use immersion and operant conditioning so that the user feels as though they are playing a game as they learn.
                  The quiz itself is multiple-choice, taking advantage of recognition over recall, and gives immediate feedback as soon as the user chooses a response. 
                A counter in the bottom right corner of the screen provides visibility throughout the quiz of the total number of questions and the number chosen correctly. At the end of the quiz,
                the app is designed to show a graph comparing the number of questions answered correctly to the total questions answered, and gives the same infromation in text to compensate for orientation
                sensitivity and the provide accessibility in case of colorblindness (the graph is portrayed in red and green).</p>
