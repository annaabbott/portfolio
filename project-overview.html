            <p class="underline">Problem:</p>
            <p> The current website was not an effective recruiting tool. Originally designed to target current students, it needed to target prospective students instead.</p>
            <p class="underline">Solution:</p> 
            <p>My team re-examined and redesigned the website from the perspective of the target user.</p>
            <p class="underline">Process: </p> 
            <p>Our team performed user research to find out what prospective culinary students were looking for when they visited the website. We also conducted eye-tracking tests to find the weaknesses in the current website. Armed with this information, we created a new design employing a clear point of entry, hierarchy of information, and improved wayfinding.</p>

            <p>Team project. I was the lead on a team of three designers.</p>

        <div class="column small-12 medium-9 large-9 overview">
            <p class="underline">Problem:</p>
            <p> The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown abruptly changed education, and the school district website was no longer relevant.</p>
            <p class="underline">Solution:</p> 
            <p>I updated the design of the website to reflect the sudden changes in what students and their families needed from the district in the face of the pandemic.</p>
            <p class="underline">Process: </p> 
            <p>I restructured the hierarchy of the landing page, adding online tools to the top and moved less-needed links to the navigation menu. 
                I designed the transcript request form to be completed online, rather than a PDF that needed to be taken to the high school in person. 
                Finally, I created a gallery of images showcasing distance learning to emphasize that school was still in session and help students to feel less alone. 
                My redesigns of the landing page, transcript form, schools page, and gallery may be viewed online.</p>

            <p class="underline">Problem:</p>
            <p> Dungeons and Dragons is a complicated game, and the players at my table had difficulty remembering the rules of the spells they had chosen.</p>
            <p class="underline">Solution:</p> 
            <p>I created a website that the players could access with their device during the game. 
                The website lists the spells of the players' choosing as well as how to use those spells.</p>
            <p class="underline">Process: </p> 
            <p>I used the dnd5e api to access the spells and associated rules. The UI I created allows the players to access spells first by character class and second by magic level. 
                Clicking on the name of the spell shows the details of that spell, which players may then choose to add to their spellbook by clicking a button.
            Adding the spell to their spellbook enables the players to continue to browse through spells without losing track of the spells they like.</p>

            <p class="underline">Problem:</p>
            <p>Create a working prototype, in code, of a real-world shopping app. The app should guide a user 
                through the entire shopping experience.</p>
            <p class="underline">Solution:</p> 
            <p>I used React to create a mock shopping website from the data contained at the makeup api.
            </p>
            <p class="underline">Process: </p> 
            <p>I originally envisioned this project as a way to learn React, but I expanded the project beyond the original requirements because I wanted to design an application that
                would include all pages necessary for a shopping app, from the landing page to the cart page. The interaction design reflects how I move through a shopping app
                 or website. I built the user interface with Material UI.
