            <p class="underline">Problem:</p>
            <p> The current website was not an effective recruiting tool. </p>
            <p class="underline">Solution:</p> 
            <p>We re-examined and redesigned the website from the perspective of the target user.</p>
            <p class="underline">Process: </p> 
            <p>Our design group performed user research to find out what prospective culinary students were looking for when they visited the website. We also conducted eye-tracking tests to find the weaknesses in the current website. Armed with this information, we created a new design employing a clear point of entry, hierarchy of information, and improved wayfinding.</p>
            <p class="underline">My role:</p>
            <p>Team project. I was the lead on a team of three designers.</p>

        <div class="column small-12 medium-9 large-9 overview">
            <p class="underline">Problem:</p>
            <p> The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown abruptly changed education, and the school district website was no longer relevant.</p>
            <p class="underline">Solution:</p> 
            <p>I updated the design of the website to reflect the sudden changes in what students and their families needed from the district in the face of the pandemic.</p>
            <p class="underline">Process: </p> 
            <p>I restructured the hierarchy of the landing page, adding online tools to the top and moved less-needed links to the navigation menu. 
                I designed the transcript request form to be completed online, rather than a PDF that needed to be taken to the high school in person. 
                Finally, I created a gallery of images showcasing distance learning to emphasize that school was still in session and help students to feel less alone. </p>

            <p class="underline">Problem:</p>
            <p> The players at my table with spellcasting characters had difficulty remembering the details of the spells they had chosen, 
                and we had only one Players Handbook between the six of us.</p>
            <p class="underline">Solution:</p> 
            <p>I created a website that the players could access with their device during the game. 
                The website lists the spells of the players' choosing as well as the details of those spells.</p>
            <p class="underline">Process: </p> 
            <p>I used the dnd5eapi to access the spells. The players access spells first by character class and second by magic level. 
                Clicking on the name of the spell shows the details of that spell, which players may then choose to add to their spellbook by clicking a button.
            Adding the spell to their spellbook enables the players to continue to browse through spells without losing track of the spells they liked.</p>
